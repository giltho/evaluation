Data collected from running [RV-Match](https://runtimeverification.com/match) on the [SV-COMP Benchmark Verification Tasks](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks). These results were collected on April 13th, 2016. More details about the verification tasks, and the structure of the benchmark can be found at [SV-COMP's website](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2016/index.php).

### Naming Convention

Verification tasks in The SV-COMP verification benchmark are organized under named after error categories [folders](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/tree/master/c). We ran RV-Match on all correct programs in these folders, and recorded the results in files that we named after the folders themselves. For instance, the file array-examples-results.txt contains the results of running RV-Match on the correct files from the array-examples folder in the benchmark.
