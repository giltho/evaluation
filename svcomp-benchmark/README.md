The [SV-benhmark](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/tree/master/c) consists of a large number of C programs that are used as verification tasks during the [SV-COMP](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2016/benchmarks.php). We took 1346 programs classified as correct from the benchmark, and made them executable by concretely defining symbolic variables and functions. We then compiled the programs with RV-Match, and ran the executables. For more information on how we compiled the programs with RV-Match, please see the [scripts](scipts/) directory. We observed that 188 programs (14 %) of the programs exhibited undefined behaviors. Upon further analyzing these programs, we found that a large number of them exhibited undefined behaviors arising from very subtle and seemingly innocuous mistakes. For instance, every correct program in the floats-cdfpl, when after compilation with RV-Match, spat out the following error - "Indeterminate value used in an expression". This error occured since the main function in every program in ```floats-cdfpl``` declared a variable ```float IN```, and used the variable without initiazing it. The presence of undefined behaviors in the programs also indicates that they were wrongly classified as correct.
