The [SV-benhmark](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/tree/master/c) consists of a large number of C programs that are used as verification tasks during the [SV-COMP](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2016/benchmarks.php). We took 1346 programs classified as correct from the benchmark, and ran them after compiling with [RV-Match](http://runtimeverification.com/match). For more information on how we compiled and ran the programs with RV-Match, please see the [scripts](scipts/) directory. 

We observed that 188 programs (14 %) of the programs exhibited undefined behaviors. Upon further analysis, we found that a large number of them exhibited undefined behaviors arising from very subtle and seemingly innocuous mistakes. For instance, every correct program in the [floats-cdfpl](https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/tree/master/c/floats-cdfpl), when after compilation with RV-Match, spat out the error - "Indeterminate value used in an expression". This error occured since the main function in every program in floats-cdfpl declared a variable ```float IN```, and used the variable in an expression without initializing it. One may choose to ignore this error, since compiling and running the program with gcc results in ```float IN``` having a garbage value, and the program doesn't crash. However, a C11 standard compliant compiler may choose to terminate the program instead, and we'd end up with a supposedly correct program that crashes on a completely valid input. Thus, it's imperative for programs classified to be correct to not exhibit undefined behavior. 

These undefined programs also present opportunities to SV-COMP participants to improve their tools. By identifying these undefined programs as false positives, participants can improve the general accuracy and effectiveness of their tools.
